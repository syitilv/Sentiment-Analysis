The task is to do Text Classification of a collection of Bahasa Indonesia document into several classes. In this assignment, I am trying to classify whether a tweet is talking about social, political, or religious issues.

The dataset is collected by using Twint (Twitter API). I choose to analyze the category from tweets of @tirtoid account, because itâ€™s an online media that actively tweets about social, political, and religious issues, and mostly they use standard Indonesia language in the tweets. The corpus contains 150 latest tweets from @tirtoid that will be labeled with 3 categories: social, political, and religious.
